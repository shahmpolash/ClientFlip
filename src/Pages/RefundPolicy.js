                        <h4>Welcome to FlipBundle.com</h4>
                        <p>Since we are offering non-tangible irrevocable, digital goods we issue refunds on a case-by-case basis only. Refunds must be requested within 15 days of the purchase order. Our sales and support team will try to resolve your issues, and if you are not satisfied, we will issue a refund.</p>

                        <h4>1. Conditions for a Refund</h4>
                        <p>You must meet ALL of the following conditions to qualify for a refund:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You are within the first 15 days of the purchase of the item.</li>
                            <li>Your issue(s) comes from not being able to install the digital product properly or get it to perform its basic functions.</li>
                            <li>You have attempted to resolve your issue(s) with our support team.</li>
                            <li>No refunds will be granted after the first 15 days of the original purchase whatsoever.</li>
                            <li>Issues caused by third-party plugins, themes, or other software will not provide grounds for a refund.</li>
                            <li>Issues related to Demo Import will not provide grounds for a refund because Demo Import depends on the hosting service.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>2. Exceptions</h4>
                        <p>In the case the product you purchased didn’t work properly as advertised and we couldn’t resolve the issue, we will offer a full refund within 15 days of the purchase. However, since the products are digitally delivered and are non-tangible goods, we can offer a refund only if the item(s) you purchased is broken, not working properly, or truly missing features as advertised on the sales page of the item(s) you purchased.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>3. Grounds for Refusal</h4>
                        <p>Issues caused by third-party plugins, themes, or other software will not provide grounds for a refund. Additionally, issues related to demo import will not provide grounds for a refund because demo import depends on the hosting service.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>4. Process for Requesting a Refund</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Read the extensive documentation related to the item you purchased.</li>
                            <li>Confirm that your server meets the specifications laid out in the requirements for the product and WordPress in general.</li>
                            <li>Open a new support ticket with our support team if you are facing issues even after going through the above two points.</li>

                        <h4>5. Refund Disputes</h4>
                        <p>If the seller accidentally opens a dispute from their bank or card or PayPal and the dispute is resolved in favor of the buyer, we will refund the amount from the seller.</p>
