                                Since we are offering non-tangible irrevocable, digital goods we issue
                                refunds case by case basis only. Refund has to be processed within 15
                                days of purchase order. Our sales and support will try to solve your
                                issues and if you are not satisfied then we will issue a refund.

                                We make our plugins, extensions, and themes with extreme care and
                                launch them only after thorough-repeated testing, so we strongly
                                believe that our products will work without any issue. If you find any
                                issue, we are available to help you solve the issue resulting from any
                                number of reasons.

                                In the case the plugin(s) or theme(s) you purchased didn’t work
                                properly as advertised and we couldn’t resolve the issue, we,
                                ThemePlace, will offer a full refund within 15 days of the purchase.
                                However, since the plugins and themes are digitally delivered and are
                                non-tangible goods, we can offer refund full or partial only if the
                                item(s) you purchased is broken, not working properly, or truly
                                missing features as advertised on the sales page of the item(s) you
                                purchased.

                                Refunds will be offered at our sole discretion. If the refund is for
                                plugin or theme renewal and you are within the first 30 days of the
                                renewal, then please get in touch with our support team and our
